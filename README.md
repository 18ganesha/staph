# Detecting phylogenetic patterns of accessory gene in closely related strains of Staphylococcus aureus
Given the horizontal gene transfer creates difficulty in finding the origin of certain genes, we can trace back up the phylogenetic tree to find a genes roots by analyzing gene differences in closely relates bacteria strains.
